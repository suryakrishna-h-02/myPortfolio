That’s a great idea, Surya 👌! Making your own portfolio using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** will really showcase both your skills and creativity. Here’s a simple roadmap to get you started:

### 🔑 Sections to Include in Your Portfolio

1. **Header / Navbar**

   * Your name or logo on the left.
   * Navigation links (Home, About, Projects, Contact).
   * Bootstrap’s `navbar` component will save time.

2. **Hero Section (Intro)**

   * A short intro line: *“Hi, I’m Surya, a Computer Science graduate and aspiring Software Tester.”*
   * A photo of you or a creative illustration.
   * A call-to-action button (e.g., “View My Work” / “Hire Me”).

3. **About Me**

   * Your background, skills, and passion.
   * You can add a resume download button.

4. **Projects / Work**

   * Use Bootstrap **cards** or **grid system** to showcase your projects like *Zencart*, *Smart IoT Pothole System*, etc.
   * Each card: project image + short description + GitHub/demo link.

5. **Skills Section**

   * Represent skills with **progress bars** or **icons** (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Testing tools).

6. **Contact Section**

   * A simple Bootstrap **form** (Name, Email, Message).
